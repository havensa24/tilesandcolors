## Screenshots

## Geographic Area
The geographic area is showing a view of what is the route of the Mukilteo/Clinton ferry from mainland Washington and Whidbey island (vice versa). 

## Available Zoom
The map loads at a zoom level of 12, but can be zoomed in further with minor updates to detail (flat color so less details in terms of terrain and possibly topography), as well as zooming further out to show more details such as nearbye airports and freeways/highways in different colors to show their difference from residential roads.
